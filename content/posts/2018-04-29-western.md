Again, it's been a while.

I did several things since then :
I have released a port of Evil Australians for the Atari Falcon.


Unfortunely i still have no idea if it works properly on real hardware....
But it works well on emulators.

The second project was one that took me a month (with plenty of breaks...).
It is my final Pebble game : Western Ideals. 

I had to scrap some plans because Fitbit plans to shutdown servers next month... Oh well.

That's all for now, thank you.
