After getting 2 RS-97, i worked on a new custom firmware for the RS-97.
It took me a while, and it was quite painful but here it is for all the revisions as Internal :

[Useless CFW link](https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/uselessrs97-internal-firmware-for-revision-2-1/)

Of course, that forced me to fix a lot of stuff, most of which you can find on my github account,
including a newer version of Handy based on Handy libretro which has an HLE Bios implementation.

However, there are still some crashes here and there but for the most part, it’s a lot more stable
than steward’s old firmware. Unfortunely, FBA does not work on it.
