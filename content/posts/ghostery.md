Due to Ghost being a piece of shit, including :
- No ability to have comments
- Upgrading taking more than 512 Mb of RAM

Among others…

I have decided this time to give nibbleblog a try and i’m already loving it :
- No use of MySQL (great against SQL injections)
- Comments allowed without the use of Ghostery or Facebook
- More lightweight than Ghost

There’s a sucessor, bludit, but it doesn’t allow comments without the use of Disqus or some shit like that.

I have already pushed some security patches, making it more lightweight and i will continue to do so.

I hope i can repost my old articles as well…
