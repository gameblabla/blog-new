I am proud to announce the release of Rubby Bird 100,  the sequel to Rubby Bird !

You thought rubbing one bird was easy enough ? Try with 100 birds instead !

The darker they become, the closer they are to death.
If you fail to keep alive with a certain amount of birds, itâ€™s game over !

Rubby Bird 100 is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameblabla.rubbybird), Sailfish OS and browsers at [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/683859) and [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/games/gameblabla/rubby-bird-100).
